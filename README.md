[INVITE LINK](https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=1292934767511212042&permissions=8&integration_type=0&scope=bot+applications.commands)

## Usage
To get started, just type ``$help`` in a channel that the bot can see (which should be all of them).
## Features
### Wallet
Every user has their own wallet, holding their coins. You can check your balance with ``$w``.

There are multiple ways to gain coins: Daily Challenges (``$daily``), being in any voice chat, loaning from the bank (``$loan``), and of course by playing our various games.

You can also be given, or give coins using ``$give [amount of coins] [@person]``.


You can play various random chance games like:
### Slots
Use ``$roll [amount of coins]`` to use a slot machine!

You can win up to x200 your bet!
### Blackjack
Use ``$bj`` to start the blackjack game process

Multiple people can join and play blackjack at the same time!

### Grid
Start a grid game with ``$grid [amount of coins] [amount of mines (1-10)]``

The lower the amount of mines the lower the payout. You have to open at least two slots to end a game.

### Horse racing
To start a horse race you have to bet on a horse (``$horsebet [amount of coins] [horse number]``)

But it is strongly recommended that you see the ``$horsestats`` first, to see the odds of winning for each horse.

Remember, those are just odds, every horse can win!

### Other

You can do a coinflip (``$flip [amount of coins] [@person]``) against another player. It is indeed 50/50.

Type ``$leaderboard`` or ``$lb`` to see the top 5 wealthiest players on the bot. It does go cross servers, so it's a true leaderboard.

Whilst playing our various games, you earn experience, with which you can level up (``$level`` to see your progress). You gain more coins from daily challenges, and from being in voice the higher your level.

You can spend your hard earned coins on items in the ``$shop``. It is strongly recommended to first check what each item does before buying it with ``$shophelp``.

To see all commands, use ``$help``.

There are some easter eggs hidden in the bot. Can **you** find them all?
